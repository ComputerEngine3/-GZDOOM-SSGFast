This weapon is intended to be used in slaughter map, replacing the original Super Shotgun, but still trying to maintain some balance while granting you **ridiculous** firepower.

### What does this weapon do?
- Gradually increasing fire rate 'till a ridiculous rate. 8.75 shot per second if you're curious.
- Rewards you ammo when killing enemy, so you can keep the slaughter going without worrying about ammunition depleting.
- Still run out of ammo? Don't worry, once your shell drop below 24, it'll slowly refill when you're not firing it. 
## How To Use It
I don't know. Probably just load it with your mod manager or sth. Be aware that it REPLACE the original SSG.
## TO DO LIST
- Clean up some code that are too stupid.
- Probably adjust the reward, it gives too much when killing cyber demon or mastermind.
